<p>12.24.2006<br>If you found this page, you probably received (and are mighty brave if you consumed) a bottle of my first attempt at brewing beer.</p>
<p>I commissioned Julie Kiefer at Julie A. Kiefer Design (who is widely known from her design on the <a href="http://www.davidgibson.com/shed">Shedteau Project</a>) to design the label. Since it's a Red Ale, I thought it was appropriate to include our red haired dog Daisy on the label. Since she and Buck (Buckamus Rex) are inseparable, he found his way onto the label too.</p>
<p> You'll want to keep the bottle, not because it's going to be a collectors item someday, but because when you return it to me, I'll give you a full one in return. Don't worry with pulling the label, I can do that, just rinse and return. </p>
