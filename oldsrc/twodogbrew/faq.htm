<p>Occasionally we receive questions about our brew and will post those here.</p>

<p>Q:<br>Is it true your beer is made in the bathtub?</p>
<p>A: <br>(Buck) This rumor was started by the red-headed one and is totally false.<br>
(Daisy) I resent that!<br>
(Buck) Not you, everybody knows you hair is Brindle colored. I'm talking about Lou Ann, the queen mother in charge.<br>
(Buck) Brewing beer in the bathtub is a rumor that is for the most part false. Yes, the beer ferments in the bath tub, but it's in a sealed container that has been sanitized before it was filled. All of the utentsils, containers, and hands (not paws, we're not allowed to participate in the brewing, we just oversee the operation) are sanitized before use to ensure bacteria is not introduced into the batch.
